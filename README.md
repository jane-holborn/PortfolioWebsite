# Portfolio Website
This is my personal portfolio website, designed with a mobile-first approach to showcase my development skills, projects and coding journey. This site features a fun aquarium theme using CSS animations to give the page a playful, lighthearted interactive vibe. ü¶Äüêü
## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** for structure and layout
- **CSS:** for styling, animations, and responsive design
- **JavaScript:** for hamburger menu functionality and accessibility
## Features
- **CSS Animations:** Bubbles rising up the page in varying opacity, sizes and speed, in conjunction with a linear gradient of colours to simulate the ocean.
- **Mobile-First Design:** Optimised layout for mobile devices, ensuring a seamless experience across all screen sizes.
- **Single Scroll Design:** The website uses a single, continuous scroll to navigate through the content, creating a seamless intuitive user experience.
- **Performance & Accessibility:** Focus on SEO optimisation, fast load times, keyboard accessibility, semantic HTML, alt text, ARIA labels, responsive design, and good colour contrast and text readability.
- **Interactive hamburger menu:** A simple JavaScript-powered hamburger menu design for navigation.
## Stretch Goals
Here are some exciting improvements and advanced features I aim to do as I continue developing my skills:
- **Crab animation:** Add a simple animation to the crab, making it shuffle around using CSS key frames. This is an achievable and fun task that I plan to implement soon.
- **Code Review & Refactoring:** Perform a thorough code review and refactor the codebase to improve structure, efficiency and maintainability.
- **Interactive Crab Animation:** Create a more complex animation where the crab skitters off the screen when clicked (desktop) or tapped (mobile). This will require combining JavaScript and CSS animations, which I plan to explore further as I advance my JS skills.
- **Menu Visibility:** Improve the visibility and user-friendliness of the hamburger menu across both mobile and desktop devices. This will involve refining its design and functionality to make it easier to see during scrolling and more accessible and easier to use.
- **Keyboard Accessibility:** Improve the keyboard accessibility by ensuring that all interactive elements are fully navigable using the keyboard. This will involve implementing proper focus management, keyboard event handling, and ensuring that the site is usable without a mouse.
- **GitHub API Integration:** Pull my public repositories directly from the GitHub API to dynamically display project details. This is an advanced feature that will help me to showcase my ability to interact with APIs and automate updates.
- **Framework Migration:** Migrate my portfolio to a React Framework to gain hands-on experience with popular modern web frameworks, improving my front-end development skills.
- **Project Pop-up with Side Scrolling:** Implement a pop-up feature for each project that displays project images, a link to the GitHub repository, and details about technology used. Add side-scrolling functionality to allow users to click left or right to navigate through multiple project photos. This will enhance user interaction and demonstrate advanced skills in UI/UX design and JavaScript.
